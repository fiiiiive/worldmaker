## Updates:
It is currently 4/26 when I am starting this, about a month or so into this project, but this is a way for me to log what I am thinking about, problems I am trying to overcome, new things I found out/learned, etc.
- Before 4/26: Wrote out World.py but still debated using objects for it, decided to work on character.py. Got a mostly functional character.py, still thinking of ways to improve it. Improvements over the month have included: learning JSON and changing ".txt" files I was writing in, to .json's so I can read/access attributes, abilities, etc faster
- 4/26: Started this blog, thinking of making this its own thing separate of README. Created the game.py file and wrote out what I hope for that part of the project. Looked back at world.py, thinking I might go the same route as character and use JSON instead of python objects. Assuming I port it to a website in JavaScript that'll probably make it easier.
